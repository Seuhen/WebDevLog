    <h2>Lucius</h2>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seuhen/WebDevLog/main/Lucius.jpg" alt="Lucius">
    <p><strong>Profession:</strong> All-Attribute Mage</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strength: 10</li>
      <li>Agility: 8</li>

    <p>Born beneath a lunar eclipse in the shattered ruins of Altherion, Lucius was marked by prophecy as the “Binder of Realms.” Gifted not with a single affinity, but with all—fire, frost, shadow, light, and entropy—he defied the elemental divides that governed mage societies.
Shunned by guilds who feared imbalance, Lucius wandered the Fractured Coast for years, mastering each discipline in solitude. Where others specialized, he synthesized. His spells don't just cast—they reconfigure reality. Scholars call him dangerous. Oracles call him necessary.
Now, Lucius seeks the mythical Archive of Omnia, a place rumored to hold the language of creation itself. He doesn't fight for power. He fights to rewrite fate… before it rewrites him.
